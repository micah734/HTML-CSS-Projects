		<main><p> Sloths are 3 times stronger than us. Most sloths are  blind  and have an excellent sense of smell. Sloths can take 30 days for them to digest a leaf. Most interestingly, they can starve to death while having a full stomach. Sloths also can fall 100 feet without injury.</p>
		<p> Here is a quote from GlobalAnimal.org</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.globalanimal.org/2014/06/17/15-surprising-sloth-facts/?gclid=CjwKCAiA1aiMBhAUEiwACw25MY8P_UA9Nr1WMYFLiN8I1T2Fc7gKELAlm1RTncs5ADiNUBLkLC9gVRoCkMEQAvD_BwE"> Sloths are adorable, slow-moving mammals native to Central and South America. They are solitary mammals and just so happen to provide a habitat for a multitude of other organisms. For instance, did you know a single sloth may be home to moths, beetles, cockroaches, fungi, and algae?</blockquote>
